## dependencies
The following JavaScript files need to be added to the "lib" directory:
* [jQuery v2.2.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.js) or any other compatible version (as **lib/jquery.js**).
* [jQuery.path v0.0.1](https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path) or any other compatible version (as **lib/jquery.path.js**).
* [FastClick Polyfill v1.0.1](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) or any other compatible version as (**lib/fastclick.js**).

Additionally, [Cordova@9.0.0](https://cordova.apache.org/) is required to build the project to a native mobile app, and the following plugins are used:
* [StatusBar](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar)
* [NativeStorage](https://github.com/TheCocoaProject/cordova-plugin-nativestorage)
* [ExitApp](https://github.com/gaqzi/cordova-plugin-exitapp)
* [YANAP](https://github.com/Wizcorp/cordova-plugin-yanap)

If running the game natively in your computer's browser, Cordova and these plugins aren't needed, but not all features may not be fully functional.

The Cordova project files are not included in this repository, but creating a new project, including the above plugins, and putting the contents of this repo in the **www** path should get the job done.

## compatibility
Crop Drop for Android was confirmed to work on Android OS versions 4, 6, and 7, on Samsung, Motorola, LG, and Google phones. The web-app version should run on almost all browsers with some quirks. Confirmed browsers:
* Firefox (tested on Windows 8.1; browser v53): **A-OK.**
* Chrome (tested on Windows 8.1, browser v57): **minor graphical quirks; major quirks when built from Cordova instead of just grabbing things from the _www_ folder, using the browser zoom function is recommended.**
* Chrome Mobile (tested on Android OS 6, v55): **A-OK.**
* Chrome Mobile (tested on iOS): **minor graphical quirks**
* Safari Mobile (tested on iOS): **minor graphical quirks**
* Waterfox Mobile (tested on Android): **minor graphical quirks**
* Firefox Mobile (tested on Android OS 6, v53): **_Completely unplayable._**

## why
I developed [Amicom](https://github.com/HauntedBees/Amicom), a virtual pet, and I found myself playing and enjoying one of the mini-games in it more than the rest of the game, so I decided to just branch that out into a more fleshed out project of its own.

## want to make changes?
Go for it, yo. Please use any GPL-compatible license for your contributions, although GNU GPLv3 is preferred. There is no guarantee that changes made to this project will be included in release versions of the game or ports of the game to other systems/storefronts.
