## dependencies
The following JavaScript files need to be added to the "lib" directory:
* [jQuery v2.2.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.js) or any other compatible version (as **lib/jquery.js**).
* [jQuery.path v0.0.1](https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path) or any other compatible version (as **lib/jquery.path.js**).
* [FastClick Polyfill v1.0.1](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) or any other compatible version as (**lib/fastclick.js**).

Additionally, [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is required to build the project to a native mobile app, and the following plugins are used:
* [StatusBar](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar)
* [NativeStorage](https://github.com/TheCocoaProject/cordova-plugin-nativestorage)
* [Facebook SDK Version 4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-facebook4)
* [ExitApp](https://github.com/gaqzi/cordova-plugin-exitapp)

If running the game natively in your computer's browser, Cordova and these plugins aren't needed, but not all features may not be fully functional.

The Cordova project files are not included in this repository, but creating a new project, including the above plugins, and putting the contents of this repo in the **www** path should get the job done.

## why
I developed [Amicom](https://github.com/HauntedBees/Amicom), a virtual pet, and I found myself playing and enjoying one of the mini-games in it more than the rest of the game, so I decided to just branch that out into a more fleshed out project of its own.

## want to make changes?
The game isn't even done yet hold your horses yo. Right now if you see something blatantly wrong feel free to make a pull request or let me know or whatever. Please use the Apache 2.0 License for all contributions. There is no guarantee that changes made to this project, even if put in the main branch, will be included in release versions of the game or ports of the game to other systems.
